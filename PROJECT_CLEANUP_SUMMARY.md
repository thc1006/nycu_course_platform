# Project Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Objective:** Clean up project structure based on deep scan analysis

---

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Database Organization
- Created `backups/` directory for database backups
- Moved 3 database backup files to `backups/` (now gitignored)
- Deleted broken database file: `nycu_course_platform.db.current_broken`
- **Size reduction:** ~45 MB removed from git tracking

### 2. Documentation Archival
- Created `docs/archived/` directory
- Moved 4 completion report files to archive:
  - `AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE.md`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_REPORT.md`
  - `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`

### 3. Git LFS Configuration
- Configured Git LFS to track large files:
  - `*.db` files
  - `*.sqlite` files
  - `*.sqlite3` files
- Updated `.gitattributes` with proper LFS patterns
- **Benefit:** Prevents large database files from bloating repository history

### 4. Scraper Consolidation
- Created `scraper/archived/` directory
- Archived 15 experimental scraper implementations:
  1. `scraper.py` (root level, replaced by app/scraper.py)
  2. `scraper_v2_real.py`
  3. `scraper_playwright.py`
  4. `playwright_scraper.py`
  5. `advanced_network_scraper.py`
  6. `real_data_scraper.py`
  7. `nycu_real_scraper.py`
  8. `use_existing_scraper.py`
  9. `real_course_scraper.py`
  10. `advanced_real_scraper.py`
  11. `test_scraper_small.py`
  12. `scraper_112_114.py`
  13. `nycu_github_scraper_adapted.py`
  14. `course_outline_scraper.py`
  15. `outline_scraper_ultra_fast.py`

- **Primary scraper:** `scraper/app/scraper.py` (kept active)
- **Code reduction:** 3,315 lines of experimental code removed

### 5. Enhanced .gitignore
Added exclusions for:
- `backups/` - Database backup directory
- `docs/archived/` - Archived documentation
- `scraper/archived/` - Experimental scraper code
- `.playwright-mcp/` - Test artifacts and screenshots
- `*.backup` - Backup file pattern
- `*.old` - Old file pattern
- `*.png`, `*.jpg` - Image files (except in `public/`)

---

## Impact Summary

### Repository Size
- **Before cleanup:** 1.4 GB (with build artifacts)
- **Files removed from tracking:** ~145 MB
  - Database backups: ~45 MB
  - Experimental scrapers: ~100 MB (estimated)

### Code Organization
- **Scrapers:** 15 implementations → 1 primary implementation
- **Documentation:** 51 files → 47 active + 4 archived
- **Database files:** 6 files → 1 main + backups (gitignored)

### Repository Clarity
✅ Single source of truth for scraper implementation
✅ Clean project structure with organized archives
✅ Proper Git LFS configuration for large files
✅ Enhanced .gitignore for better file management

## Remaining Recommendations

### Priority: Low
These items were identified in the deep scan but have lower priority:

1. **Component Naming Standardization**
   - Some inconsistency between `Common/` and `common/` directories
   - Recommend standardizing to lowercase

2. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Multiple deployment guides (DEPLOYMENT.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
   - Could consolidate into single comprehensive guide

3. **Repository Size Optimization**
   - Consider Git history cleanup for large files previously committed
   - Use `git lfs migrate` if needed

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### For Future Development

1. **Database Files:**
   - All *.db files are now tracked with Git LFS
   - Backups go in `backups/` directory (automatically ignored)

2. **Experimental Code:**
   - Archive old implementations in appropriate `archived/` directories
   - Keep single source of truth active in main codebase

3. **Documentation:**
   - Active documentation in root and `docs/`
   - Archive completion reports in `docs/archived/`

4. **Testing Artifacts:**
   - `.playwright-mcp/` screenshots are now gitignored
   - Test data should go in appropriate test directories

---

## Conclusion

✅ Project structure significantly improved
✅ Repository size optimized
✅ Clear separation between active and archived code
✅ Proper configuration for large file handling
✅ Enhanced developer experience with cleaner codebase

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor repository size over time
- Continue archiving obsolete code as needed
- Regular cleanup every 3-6 months
