## 3. DATA COLLECTION APPROACHES

### APPROACH A: Direct API Scraping (RECOMMENDED)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Fetch semester list: `POST ?r=main/get_acysem`
2. For each semester 110-114:
   - Send POST with semester code to `?r=main/getViewHtmlContents`
   - Parse HTML table to extract courses
   - Extract fields: number, name, teacher, credits, time, room, dept

**Advantages:**
- Real-time data
- Official source
- Automated updates possible

**Challenges:**
- HTML parsing required (not pure JSON)
- JavaScript context needed for browser
- 15-19 hours implementation

**Effort**: Medium (4-6 hours parsing + 8-10 hours extraction)

---

### APPROACH B: Use GitHub Scraper

**Source**: https://github.com/Huskyee/NYCU_Timetable

**Advantages:**
- Already tested and working
- Python/JavaScript implementation available
- Schedule conflict detection included

**Disadvantages:**
- Community-maintained, not official
- Need to adapt data format to platform

**Effort**: Low (6-8 hours integration)

---

### APPROACH C: Contact NYCU IT Department

**Advantages:**
- Guaranteed data accuracy
- Potential official data export
- Institutional support

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires formal request
- May take weeks for response
- Possible data export limitations

**Effort**: Unknown (depends on NYCU response)

---

## 8. KEY DISCOVERIES

1. **NYCU Does Not Publish Direct JSON API**
   - Course data available, but returned as HTML tables
   - Requires parsing, not direct JSON consumption
   - This is intentional for performance/security

2. **Semester Code Format**
   - YYSX: YY=year (110-114), S=semester (1=fall, 2=spring, X=summer)
   - Example: 1141 = Year 114, Fall semester

3. **Data Quality**
   - Official, verified source
   - Used by NYCU students daily
   - Trusted reliability

4. **Multiple Access Paths**
   - Timetable system (primary)
   - Course registration system (secondary)
   - GitHub community scrapers (tertiary)

## 9. RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| HTML structure changes | Parser breaks | Version control, continuous testing |
| Rate limiting | Data collection fails | Implement backoff strategy, caching |
| Course data volume | Large file sizes | Pagination, incremental updates |
| Encoding issues | Garbled text | UTF-8 handling, test coverage |
